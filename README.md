# GUI-Chat-Room
It is TCP Chatroom developed in Python3 containing a simple GUI in the client side. 

The server.py has been developed primarily using 'threading' and 'socket'. Also as 'os' and 'argparse' have been used for better implementation.
Similarly, for client.py all the above modules are used along with tkinter for GUI has been used.
<So no need of additional module installation is required ;D>

To implement the server-side script use the following syntax:
Linux/MacOS: 'python3 server.py <host-name>'
Windows: 'python server.py <host-name>'
Example: 'python/python3 server.py localhost'

Similarly to implement client-side script use the following syntax:
Linux/MacOS: 'python3 client.py <host-name>'
Windows: 'python client.py <host-name>'
Example: 'python/python3 client.py localhost'
  
  Future Planning:
  I am planning to use Django to give a backend support and host it as a web page. Any contribution towards the development will be whole-heartedly welcomed and celebrated.
  
  If any error or issue faced feel free to let me know :D
